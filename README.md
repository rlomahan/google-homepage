This is a beginner project focused on utilizing the introductory skills that I have gained from The Odin Project to create a Google homepage look-a-like.

I have used the following skills to achieve this (updated as the project goes on):
    Basic HTML and CSS learned from TOP and CodeAcademy Front-end Basics.
    Simple hover state styling such as box-shadows, text-underlining, and background-color changes.
    Inspect element and Chrome DevTools used sparingly to only get an idea of certain items such as the size of the search bar/search buttons.
    Utilize an HTML skeleton, a Horizontal Navigation Bar, and a dropdown bar from W3Schools.
    Utilize a starting CSS grid code from Chrome DevTools articles that lay down the foundation of the webpage. 
    

Some notes to take into consideration:
    All links are empty links.
    My webpage is strictly for displaying the Google homepage visually, so some responsiveness such as the "I'm feeling lucky" button will not execute as the original Google homepage will.
